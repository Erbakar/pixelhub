      <p>The UI/UX design landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with 2025 bringing exciting new trends that prioritize user experience, accessibility, and innovative interactions.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Neomorphism and Soft UI</h3>
      <p>Neomorphism creates interfaces that appear to extrude from the background using subtle shadows and highlights for a tactile, almost physical appearance.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Dark Mode and Theme Switching</h3>
      <p>Dark mode has become essential rather than optional. Users expect the ability to switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Micro-Interactions and Animation</h3>
      <p>Thoughtful micro-interactions provide feedback, guide users, and create delightful experiences. These small animations significantly impact user satisfaction.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Inclusive and Accessible Design</h3>
      <p>Accessibility is no longer an afterthought but a fundamental requirement. Designing for all users creates better experiences for everyone.</p>
      
      <p>Staying ahead of design trends while maintaining usability and accessibility is key to creating successful digital products in 2025.</p>

      <p>JavaScript performance directly impacts user experience and SEO rankings. This guide covers advanced optimization techniques to make your applications lightning-fast.</p>
      
      <h3>Code Splitting and Lazy Loading</h3>
      <p>Break your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks that load only when needed. This reduces initial page load time and improves user experience.</p>
      
      <h4>Dynamic Imports:</h4>
      <pre><code>// Lazy load components
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

// Dynamic route loading
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/dashboard',
    component: () => import('./Dashboard')
  }
];</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Memory Management</h3>
      <p>Prevent memory leaks by properly cleaning up event listeners, timers, and subscriptions.</p>
      
      <h3>Bundle Optimization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tree shaking to remove unused code</li>
        <li>Webpack bundle analysis</li>
        <li>Minification and compression</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Building Your Design System</h3>
      <h4>1. Design Tokens</h4>
      <p>Start with design tokens—the atomic elements of your design system including colors, typography, spacing, and shadows.</p>
      
      <h4>2. Component Library</h4>
      <p>Build reusable UI components with clear APIs and documentation. Tools like Storybook help develop and document components in isolation.</p>
      
      <h3>Documentation and Governance</h3>
      <p>Comprehensive documentation and clear governance ensure your design system remains useful and adopted across teams.</p>

      <p>Web accessibility ensures that websites and applications are usable by people with disabilities. This comprehensive guide covers WCAG 2.1 implementation and best practices.</p>
      
      <h3>Understanding WCAG 2.1</h3>
      <p>WCAG 2.1 is organized around four main principles (POUR):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive</li>
        <li><strong>Operable:</strong> Interface components must be operable</li>
        <li><strong>Understandable:</strong> Information and UI operation must be understandable</li>
        <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Content must be robust for assistive technologies</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Implementation Strategies</h3>
      <h4>1. Semantic HTML</h4>
      <p>Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose. Headers should use h1-h6 tags, lists should use ul/ol tags.</p>
      
      <h4>2. Keyboard Navigation</h4>
      <p>Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed using only a keyboard with proper focus indicators.</p>
      
      <h3>Testing Your Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Use automated tools like axe-core or WAVE, but remember that manual testing is essential for comprehensive accessibility validation.</p>
      
      <p>Accessibility is an ongoing commitment that benefits all users and improves overall user experience quality.</p>
